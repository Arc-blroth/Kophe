## Welcome!

This repository hosts the source "code" for FRC Team 8060's
Programming Workshops.
It will eventually contain 12 chapters covering most of the
Java language and ecosystem and the FRC ecosystem.

This is currently a work-in-progress: expect updates every week
on Monday as I procrastinate writing lessons for each week's
workshop lol.
